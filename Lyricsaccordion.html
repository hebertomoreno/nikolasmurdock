							<p>I'm on to you <br/>

							the things you do are never <br/>

							<p>The way you plan the way you<br/>
							Move your pieces<br/>
							It's about time that your<br/>
							Arrow misses<br/></p>

							<p>I'm on to you and all those<br/>
							Pretty things you say<br/>
							The words you use they seem to<br/>
							Cast a spell<br/></p>

							<p>I better run I better<br/>
							Hide my head<br/>
							Your deep blue eyes they're gonna<br/>
							Kill me dead<br/></p>

							<p>And everytime you make your move<br/>
							The audience freezes<br/>
							And everytime you call my name<br/>
							I just lose control<br/>
							And every time you come on by I say I'm<br/>
							Doing just fine<br/>
							Oh but I'm actually quite close to suicide<br/></p>

							<p>Time you cry, my heart <br/>
							just stops and every<br/>
							Time you smile my mouth <br/>
							it drops to the floor</p>

							<p>I've never met someone<br/>
							I've never caught someone<br/>
							I've never loved someone like you<br/>
							Someone like you</p>

							<p>I'm lying in my bed just<br/>
							Thinking about our wedding day<br/>
							and there'll be a <br/>
							huge cake and lots of food and <br/>
							while everybody's dancing<br/>
							we'll exit through the back door</p>

							<p>And they'll never see us again<br/>
							'cause we'll be far off in a plane<br/>
							I've never been on a plane with you<br/>
							or with someone like you</p>

							<p>We'll spend our honeymooon in france and we'll<br/>
							laugh because nobody understands and then we'll<br/>
							eat so much that we cannot move and so<br/>
							we'll spend the day in our hotel room<br/>
							just thinking</p>

							<p>How did we do before?<br/>
							How did we pass our days?<br/>
							How did we spend our lives before this?<br/>
							Before you and me together</p>

							<p>It felt a bit like being blind <br/>
							In the recently rained rapids<br/>
							And the colors of the trees<br/>
							Seem to blend with the skies</p>

							<p>And the current was so strong<br/>
							That my feet and arms were lifted<br/>
							In an effort to maintain<br/>
							My newly loved life</p>

							<p>And I said someday<br/>
							I'll be coming<br/>
							Back again</p>

							<p>'Cause I always seem <br/>
							to be coming<br/>
							Back again</p>

							<p>And the angels in the heavens<br/>
							And the demons far below<br/>
							They made bets against each other<br/>
							On the purity of my soul</p>

							<p>But no oxygen was wasted<br/>
							As I swam and gasped for air<br/>
							No single moment for despair<br/>
							No regrets for being there</p>

							<p>And I said someday <br/>
							I'll be coming<br/>
							Back again</p>

							<p>'Cause I always seem <br/>
							to be coming<br/>
							Back again</p>

							<p>And I said someday <br/>
							I'll be coming<br/>
							Back again</p>

							<p>And I said someday <br/>
							I'll be coming<br/>
							Back again</p>

							<p>Holding breaths and taking swallows<br/>
							Found myself again<br/>
							Being free</p>

							<p>As her lips parted and she said</p>

							<p>Maybe<br/>
							Why not<br/>
							We´ll see</p>

							<p>I should have known that you were letting go<br/>
							When I saw your smile wither away<br/>
							Something grabbed me from the shadows while I waited for<br/>

							<p>There was a magic in your eyes<br/>
							Something I'm not able to describe<br/>
							And I can't seem to revive it though I try so hard<br/>
							'Cause it used to get me high</p>

							<p>And I guess that what I'm trying to say is I've missed you<br/>
							I've missed you since you went away<br/>
							And I guess that what I'm trying to say is I've loved you<br/>
							I've loved you since you went away</p>

							<p>We placed the flowers on the street <br/>
							Your mother sang a lullabye<br/>
							There was no words that we could speak<br/>
							no tears tears that anyone  could cry</p>

							<p>My mother said it wasn't meant to be<br/>
							And my father looked away<br/>
							And every time they ask me if I am ok I say<br/>
							Eventually<br/>

							<p>It's Christmas<br/>
							I'm all alone<br/>
							I'm sitting on the back porch of my<br/>
							Grandma's home<br/>
							To see if you can still climb that wall</p>

							<p>You told me to wait so that's what I did<br/>
							But I ended up broken and my face with a grin<br/>
							Like what I'm going through is nothing to cry home about<br/>
							Like what I'm going through is nothing to be sad about<br/>
							Like what I'm going through is nothing to be depressed about<br/>
							Like what's happening<br/>
							Is normal<br/>
							To me</p>

							<p>It's New Years<br/>
							I'm all alone<br/>
							I'm sitting on my car trying to forget<br/>
							Who you are but I'm not<br/>
							Succeeding<br/>
							And I think about the time you told me love was not real<br/>
							And I thought about the time I thought that this was it<br/>
							And I thought about the time I tried to get you home<br/>
							When I was drunk<br/>
							And we crashed</p>

							<p>And I'm wondering if i'll ever get to see your face again<br/>
							And I'm wondering if I'll ever get to see your smile again<br/>
							I've been smoking for so long that I've forgotten what it's like<br/>
							To see the sun rise<br/>
							behind your eyes</p>

							<p>And I´ve forgotten what it's like to see your smile again<br/>
							And I've forgotten what it's like to see you dancing in the dark<br/>
							And I've forgotten what it's like to be the man you hold dear<br/>
							and call your boyfriend<br/>
							This is not working<br/>
							For me</p>
